## Getting Started

### Usage

* To open the executable file:GO TO Simple container GUI ->Win32->Release->Simple Container System.exe
* To open the source code:Simple Container System->Simple Container System.cbproj

## The logic

* We add data to the container and manipulate it with c++ code by some buttons.

 ## Technical decisions and Trade-offs
 * I used C++ as they are considered the fastest.
 * I used some data structures to make the program run smoothly with no errors.

## Possible future improvements
* I will try to make it much more fancy with the UI, shapes of the buttons, add more useful operations and etc.
## How to run and source code
* To open the executable file:GO TO Simple container GUI ->Win32->Release->Simple Container System.exe
* To open the source code:Simple Container System->Simple Container System.cbproj
